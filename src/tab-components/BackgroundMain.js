      <h3>What is it about?</h3>
      <p> &nbsp; This site is your guide to my Catalyst project: an activity called New Day New Me that consists of a deck of cards and a journal.
        The activities are based on the concept of a New Year's resolution, please use the cards in discovering the new you!
        <br></br>
        &nbsp; This website covers the instructions for the journal, cards, and everything you possibly need.
        I designed this project to be a touch and feel activity, a fun occasion for friends and family members to get together— away from their devices.</p>

      <h1> THE PROJECT </h1>
      <h3>What is it?</h3>
      <p> &nbsp; My Catalyst project consists of a card deck and a weekly journaling activity.
        The card deck includes 52 unique activities (one for every week of the year) with four sections: Food, Exercise, Mindfulness, and Life Skills.
        The cards help you get to know yourself better and push you to try new things.
        They're made to help you become more adventurous, courageous, habitualized, observational, thoughtful, and more.
        It is great if you complete all 52 of them, but you don't have to.
        Just have fun and try your best on each and every one of the cards.</p>
